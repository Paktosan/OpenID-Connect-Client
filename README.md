# OpenID Connect Client
An implementation of the OpenID Connect Client for Java.

##Goal of this project
The goal of this project is to provide an easy to use library for usage in any Java project.
In the short term I am planning to follow [the basic implementation guide](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-basic-1_0.html)
and may extend to the full core specification afterwards.
